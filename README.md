To do:

 - Make the Animator generic so it can be used for arbitrary properties and therefore can animate the camera
 - Experiment with Cel-Shading
 - Smooth animation
 - Wrap shader programs with easy changing between them
 - Investigate better texturing using all the texture units
 - Complete lighting model with multiple lights and full lighting parameters
 - Load Scenes from a file
 - Load Animations from a file
 - Support composite models (i.e. a Person with arms, legs, etc)
 - Allow for Animations in relation to other parts of a model
